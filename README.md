# gh-sm
GitHub source code manager - automates building
## Installation
### Debian
If you do not already have git installed:
```bash
sudo apt-get udpate && sudo apt install git
```
Then, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/atomizeur/gh-sm.git
```
Change directory into the download folder:
```bash
cd gh-sm
```
Make the setup script executable:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```
And finally, run the setup script:
```bash
./setup.sh
```
## Usage
```bash
ghsm
```
Then, follow the instructions to install your package!!

Note: it likely won't be able to find/install your package without some configuration first (kinda defeats the purpose, I know).
